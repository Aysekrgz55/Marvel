<a>Mutant Power (Example + Explanation) Explanation Mutant powers are innate. Characters like X-Men members have abilities such as telepathy, elemental control, healing factor, or shapeshifting. Example Text “He closed his eyes and opened his mind. 
Suddenly, the thoughts of everyone in the room began reaching him in whispers. Fears, hopes, secret plans… They all echoed inside his mind. This was not a curse; it was a unique gift that Marvel Power gave to mutants.” </a>

<a>Technological Power  (Example + Explanation) Explanation Technology-based powers, like Iron Man's, War Machine's, or Spider-Man's suits, are achieved through intelligence, engineering, and science. These powers are not innate but are gained through creativity. Example Text “When the armor's engines activated, the sky was filled with a metallic hum.
 Hundreds of data streams flowed across the HUD screen, targets marked in red. 
  He was no longer just a human; he was a force combined with technology. Marvel Power once again proved that intelligence knows no bounds.”</a>
